# Particle Alarm (Based off Alarm-ios-swift)

Based off natsu1211's unfinished [code](https://github.com/natsu1211/Alarm-ios-swift) this project aims to create an IoT alarm.
Designed to be used with the Particle Photon, the app allows a user to login to 
their Particle account, take display and select their devices and trigger a 
specific function on it's firmware.

## Caution
To improve iOS 10 usage the UIUserNotifications are being changed to NSNotifications.
Alarms will not be fully functional until this is complete.
